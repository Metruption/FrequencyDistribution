#Frequency Distribution

A python module that can be used to generate Frequency Distributions. I made this because lots of my homework for a statistics class in college required me to do lots of repetitive, and inane work. Instead I chose to create a piece of software able to do it for me instead.

@todo(aaron): write documentation (I'll probably only do this if someone opens an issue on GitHub asking for documentation...)
